#this section shown examples about primitive datatypes 
"""
primitive datatypes is about the arthmetic expression 
like addition
subtraction division and modules"""
#first seen about simple arthmetic problem....
a = 10

b = 20

print(a+b)#this is simple math
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b)
print(a%b)

"""the above code is showed primitive datattypes in python"""


'''order execution is main rules in computer programming 

there is called as bodmas rules...

b->bracket
o->power
d->division
m->multiplication
a->additon
s->substraction '''
print("im from bodmass rules")
a=2
b=3
print((a+b**2+(a+b)**2)/2)


#datatypes of python not for python only all programming lang using same syntax of datatypes
'''
integer
float
string
boolean

these are the datatypes in python'''
